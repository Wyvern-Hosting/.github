# Welcome to our GitHub 👋

Here at Wyvern, we tend to strive giving you free and paid hosting!

# What do we have to improve your gaming experience? ✨
  * A complete new design with more exciting features
  * Ways to customize the server with 2 clicks
  * Fully open source projects
  * A bunch of supported games
  * And much more coming soon!

# How do we communicate 💬

We have a discord server! *(not suprising..)* but you can join it! Head over to https://discord.wyvernpanel.com and become one of us!

We are also going to use GitHub discussions. You can access the discussion page by clicking on the ***Discussion*** tab on our organization's page. Once there, you'll find a few categories. See news and updates in `📣 Announcements`, chat with everyone in `💬 General` and ask questions in `🙏 Q&A`.
